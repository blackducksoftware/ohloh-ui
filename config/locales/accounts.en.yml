In addition, your email address may be used by Open Hub to match against discovered, unclaimed committer IDs on projects as a convenient way to locate your FOSS contributions. You may change your email address; we will send an activiation letter to that address for confirmation.
      help_3: Open Hub will never show your email addresses to anyone on the site or through the API.
