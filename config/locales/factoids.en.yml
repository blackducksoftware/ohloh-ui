      nobody_1: "The source code for %{link} has not been changed in over a year."
      nobody_2: "Over 75% of all projects on Open Hub have no recent activity. Open source has a \"long tail\" of projects whose developers have moved on. But the code is still there for all to benefit from!"
      single_1: "During the past twelve months, this project has had only one active contributor."
      single_2: "Over half of all active projects on Open Hub are solo efforts."
      small: "Over the past twelve months, %{count} developers contributed new code to %{link}, making this a relatively small project team."
      avg: "Over the past twelve months, %{count} developers contributed to %{link}. This is an average size team compared to all projects on Open Hub."
      large: "Over the past twelve months, %{count} developers contributed to %{link}. This project has a relatively large team, in the top 10% of all project teams on Open Hub."
      huge: "Over the past twelve months, %{count} developers contributed new code to %{link}. This is one of the largest open-source teams in the world, and is in the top 2% of all project teams on Open Hub."
      developer: "developer"
      all_time: "For this measurement, Open Hub considers only recent changes to the code. Over the entire history of the project, %{link} have contributed."
    age:
      young_1: "The source code repository for %{link} has less than a year of continuous activity. This likely is a relatively new project."
      young_2: "A short history is not necessarily a bad thing (all projects have to start somewhere!) but often, newer projects are changing rapidly and are thus less stable. They are also often innovative and exciting!"
      young_3: "As this project matures, a longer source control history in conjunction with recent activity might indicate that the project has enough merit to hold contributors' interest for a long time. It might indicate a mature and relatively bug-free code base, and can be a sign of an organized, dedicated development team."
      old_1: "The first lines of source code were added to %{link} in %{year}. If this older project has had recent activity, then this project likely is consistently delivering value, and attracts sustained effort from the community."
      old_2: "A longer source control history in conjunction with recent activity such as with this project, may indicate that this code base and community have enough value to hold contributors' interest for a long time. It may also indicate a mature and relatively bug-free code base, and can be a sign of an organized, dedicated development team."
      established_1: "The first lines of source code were added to %{link} in %{month}, %{year}. If this young project has had recent activity, then it likely has passed its critical early start-up period, and has become established. The project still may be rapidly changing, innovative and exciting, and finding its focus."
      established_2: "As this project matures, a longer source control history in conjunction with recent activity might indicate that the project has enough merit to hold contributors interest for a long time. It might indicate a mature and relatively bug-free code base, and can be a sign of an organized, dedicated development team."
      very_old_1: "The first lines of source code were added to %{link} in %{year}. Projects with recent activity, and a code base more than five years old are likely solving vital problems and delivering consistent value, and may be organized to reward sustained effort by an engaged team of contributors."
      very_old_2: "Such a lengthy source control history in conjunction with recent activity may indicate that this code base and community are important enough to attract long-term commitment, and may also indicate a mature and relatively bug-free code base."
      note: "Note:"
      note_body: "The source code for %{name} might actually be older than the source control history can reveal. Many new projects begin by incorporating a large amount of source code from existing, older projects. You might be able to tell whether this is the case by looking for a rapid rise in the amount of code early in the project's history."
    activity:
      activity: "Over the last twelve months, %{link} "
      increasing: "has seen a substantial increase in activity. This may be a sign that interest in this project is rising, and that the open source community has embraced this project."
      stable: "has not seen any change in activity. This may be a good sign, and an indication that development is continuing at the same pace and not dropping off."
      decreasing: "has seen a substantial decrease in development activity. This could mean many things. It may be a warning sign that interest in this project is waning, or it may indicate a maturing code base that requires fewer fixes and changes. It is also possible that development on this project has moved to a new source control repository somewhere else."
      activity_note: "Open Hub makes this determination by comparing the total number of commits made by all developers during the most recent twelve months with the same figure for the prior twelve months. The number of developers and total lines of code are not considered."
    comments:
      comments_1_html: "%{link} is written mostly in %{lang_name}."
      comments_2: "Across all %{lang_name} projects on Open Hub, %{percent} of all source code lines are comments."
      avg: "For %{name}, this figure is %{percent}."
      only: "For %{name}, this figure is only %{percent}."
      comments_very_low: "This lack of comments puts %{name} among the lowest 10% of all %{lang_name} projects on Open Hub."
      comments_low: "This lack of comments puts %{name} among the lowest one-third of all %{lang_name} projects on Open Hub."
      comments_average: "This holds true for %{name} as well. It contains the same ratio of comment lines to code lines as the majority of %{lang_name} projects in Open Hub."
      comments_high: "This high number of comments puts %{name} among the highest one-third of all %{lang_name} projects on Open Hub."
      comments_very_high: "This very impressive number of comments puts %{name} among the top 10% of all %{lang_name} projects on Open Hub."
      comments_note: "A high number of comments might indicate that the code is well-documented and organized, and could be a sign of a helpful and disciplined development team."
