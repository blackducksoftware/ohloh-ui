## Security
The Black Duck Vulnerability Disclosure Process is executed by the Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT). The Black Duck process is based on well-known industry standards, such as NIST-SP-800-61, ISO 29147, and ISO 30111. 

The Black Duck PSIRT coordinates the response and, if necessary, disclosure of security incidents related to Black Duck products and associated software. Black Duck PSIRT's primary objective is to minimize the risks associated with security incidents in a timely, secure, and responsible manner.

Black Duck will investigate all reports for Black Duck products/platforms that are currently supported; accepted reports will be prioritized based on severity and other environmental factors.â€¯
